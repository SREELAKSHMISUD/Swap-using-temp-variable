# Swap-using-temp-variable
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating swapping names using a temporary variable

## Description

The program demonstrates a basic concept in programming: swapping the values of two variables. In this case, it swaps the values of two string variables, `name` and `name2`, using a temporary variable `c`. You can also use numbers with help of this code.

## Code Example

Here's the code that performs the swap:

```python
# Swap numbers using a temporary variable
name = "sree"
name2 = "lakshmi"
c = name
name = name2
name2 = c
print("a:", name)
print("b:", name2)
```

### Output

```
a: lakshmi
b: sree
```
